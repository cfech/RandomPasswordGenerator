# RandomPasswordGenerator
I used a combination of html, css, and javascript in order to create a random password generator. When you click on the generate button, a series of prompts pop-up asking for the specifics of the password that you wish to have in your random password, after the you input your preferences a random password is generated and displayed on screen. <link>
